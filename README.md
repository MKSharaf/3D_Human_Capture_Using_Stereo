## 3D Motion Capture
This project was made as part of my learning experince in trying to move my knowledge into 3D space when it comes to Computer Vision.
It is seperated into 2 phases, the first one is successfully getting the pose estimation into the 3D space, the second phase would be getting the movements properly mapped to a 3D model.

## Try it out
1) Connect the 2 cameras.
2) Run `calibration_images` to capture the needed images.

3) Press `s` to capture the images.
4) Run `cammera_calibration` to calibrate the cameras and save the file needed to calculate the distance of each keypoint.
5) Run `main` to start the process of 3D pose estimation.

## Future Work
1) Connect the program with a 3rd party 3D program.
2) Visualize the movements with a 3D rigged model.

## Explanation
I'll soon explain the code and the algorithms used.
